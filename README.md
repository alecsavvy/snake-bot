# Snake Bot ðŸ‘¾ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘½ðŸ¤ 

A twitch bot for my friend's twitch channel. Has some specific commands but is mostly generic.

## Configuration

1. Make sure you have `npm` installed.
2. Run an `npm install` to gather all dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of this project with this structure.
   ```
   USERNAME=bot_username
   PASSWORD=oauth:bot_password
   CHANNELS=comma,separated,list,of,channels,bot,will,join
   ```
4. Run `npm start`!

## TODO

1. Web front end for control when a mod isn't around.
2. Mod specific commands and actions.
3. Github hooks with twitch to run bot without handlebars!
